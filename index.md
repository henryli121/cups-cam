# Cambridge University Photography Society (CUPS)

Established in 2025, CUPS aims to foster a creative and inclusive community for all University of Cambridge students interested in photography, whether using professional cameras or mobile phones.

## What We Do

We organize photography workshops, photowalks, exhibitions, and social events to help members develop their skills and share their passion for photography.
